## Prerequisites

Before running the microservices or working with the Terraform scripts using LocalStack, make sure you have the following installed:

### Explanation of Key Tools:

- **Java 17**:  
  Required to run your Java-based microservices.  
  You can download and install Java 17 from the [Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk17-downloads.html) or  
  use an OpenJDK distribution such as: [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=17).  
  To verify installation, run the following command:
  ```bash
  java -version
  ```
- **Maven**:  
  Required to build and manage dependencies for the Java microservices.  
  You can download and install Maven from the [official Maven website](https://maven.apache.org/install.html).  
  To verify Maven installation, run:
  ```bash
  mvn -v
  ```
- **Docker**:  
  Needed to containerize your microservices and run them in isolated environments.  
  You can download and install Docker from the [Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/).  
  To verify Docker installation, run:
  ```bash
  docker --version
  ```
- **Docker Compose**:  
  Helps manage multi-container Docker applications. It's used to orchestrate and run your microservices together locally.  
  Docker Compose comes bundled with Docker Desktop, or you can install it separately by following instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).  
  To verify Docker Compose installation, run:
  ```bash
  docker-compose --version
  ```
- **Terraform**:  
  An Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool used for managing cloud infrastructure resources, such as AWS services.  
  You can download and install Terraform from the [official Terraform website](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install?product_intent=terraform).  
  To verify Terraform installation, run:
  ```bash
  terraform -v
  ```

- **LocalStack**:  
  A fully functional local AWS cloud stack that allows you to develop and test cloud applications offline. 
  It provides a local environment that simulates various AWS services, such as S3, DynamoDB, Lambda, and more.  
  You can install LocalStack using pip.
  ```bash
  pip install localstack
  ```
  Verify Installation: Once installed, you can verify that LocalStack is correctly installed by checking the version:
  ```bash
  localstack --version
  ```

- **tflocal**:  
  tflocal is a wrapper around Terraform that is designed to work with LocalStack.  
  To install tflocal, you can use pip:
  ```bash
  pip install terraform-local
  ```
  Verify that tflocal is installed correctly:
  ```bash
  tflocal -v
  ```

## Getting Started

### 1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
 git clone https://github.com/jcondotta/bank-account-recipients.git
 cd bank-account-recipients
```

### 2. **Build the project and resolve dependencies**:
```bash
mvn clean install -DskipTests

# If you'd like to build the project and execute all tests, run instead:
mvn clean install
```

### 3. **Configure AWS Credentials for LocalStack**:  
   In order to interact with LocalStack's simulated AWS services, you need to configure a separate AWS profile. This profile will have mock credentials, region, and the LocalStack endpoint.
   <br><br>
   Run aws configure with the LocalStack profile:
   ```bash
   aws configure --profile localstack
   ```  
   Enter the following values when prompted:  
   When running the above command, AWS CLI will prompt you to enter the access key, secret key, region, and output format. Provide the values below:
   ```bash
   AWS Access Key ID [None]: test
   AWS Secret Access Key [None]: test
   Default region name [None]: us-east-1
   Default output format [None]: json
   ```

### 4. **Run the Microservice Locally with Docker Compose**:
  Use Docker Compose to run the microservice along with its dependencies in the background:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### 5. **Build up the infrastructure**
```bash
# Navigate to the terraform directory
cd terraform

# Initialize Terraform with LocalStack
tflocal init

# Apply the infrastructure changes using the development environment-specific variables: 
tflocal apply -var-file="./environments/dev/terraform.localstack.tfvars"

# When all the resources are ready to be created, Terraform will prompt for confirmation before proceeding.   
# To confirm and initiate the creation of the resources, simply type yes when prompted.
```

### 6. **Run the Java Application**:
  Once the infrastructure is ready, run the Java application to start the microservice:

```bash
# Navigate back to the root project directory
cd ..

# Run the following command to start the Bank Account Recipients application
java -cp target/bank-account-recipients-0.1.jar com.jcondotta.recipients.Application

# If everything works correctly, you should see logs similar to the following:
 __  __ _                                  _   
|  \/  (_) ___ _ __ ___  _ __   __ _ _   _| |_

```

### 7. Calling REST APIs
  To interact with secure API endpoints, you must first authenticate and obtain a token from the Login API. Follow the steps below:

1. **Authenticate to Obtain a Token**  
    You need to make a POST request to the Login API, providing a username and password. For this test environment, the credentials are predefined as username=default and password=default.
```json
{
  "username": "default",
  "password": "default"
}
```
Using cURL to Make the Request:
```bash
curl -i --request POST \
  --url 'http://localhost:8086/login' \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data-raw '{"username": "default", "password": "default"}'
```
2. **Retrieve the Token**:    
    If the request is successful, the API will respond with a JWT (JSON Web Token). The response will look similar to this:
```json
{
  "access_token":"eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJkZWZhdWx0IiwibmJmIjo...",
  "token_type":"Bearer",
  "expires_in":3600,
  "username":"default"
}
```
3. **Store the Token**:        
    Copy and save the access_token from the response. This token will be used for authentication when making requests to protected endpoints.


4. **Use the Token for Subsequent API Calls**
    To access protected endpoints, include the token in the Authorization header as a Bearer token. Hereâ€™s an example using cURL:
```bash
curl -i --request POST \
  --url 'http://localhost:8086/api/v1/recipients' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <your-access-token>' \
  --data-raw '{
    "bankAccountId": "01920bff-1338-7efd-ade6-e9128debe5d4",
    "recipientName": "My first recipient",
    "recipientIban": "IT49W0300203280114524628857"
  }'
```
